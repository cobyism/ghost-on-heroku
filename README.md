# [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) on [Heroku](http://heroku.com)

Ghost is a free, open, simple blogging platform. Visit the project's website at <http://ghost.org>, or read the docs on <http://support.ghost.org>.

Getting started:

To install
`npm install`

To start
`npm start`

and go to `http://t.ful:2368/`

NOTE: For the first time, go to `http://t.ful:2368/ghost/setup/`` and follow instructions. This sets up a db locally so you can use the admin panel and switch to the correct theme we are using. After you complete set up go to `http://t.ful:2368/ghost/` --> "General" --> scroll down to "Themes" --> Activate Roon 1.1
